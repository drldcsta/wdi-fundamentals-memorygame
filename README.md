![Deliverable](https://ga-instruction.s3.amazonaws.com/json/WDI-Fundamentals/assets/unit-11/deliverable.gif)

### Enhancements 
 * Instructions have transition effects
 * Able to start new game without refreshing page
 * Able to flip cards without refreshing page
 * Logic to protect against "same card" cheat
 * Board shuffles cards every new game
 * Special prize for winning
 * Custom favicon
 * In page Easter egg from cinematic masterpiece, 1996's The Net
 * Console Easter egg

### Issues/TODO
* CSS is a mess (I finally "get" CSS jokes)
* Something is screwy with the meta tags
 * Slack unfurl definitely seems broken, FB and twitter likely broken
* what I'm doing to hide `.instructions` can't possibly be the best way to do this. 
* There's almost certainly no way that using iframes to set background videos makes sense
